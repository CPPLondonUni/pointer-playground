# Pointer Playground (and references too)

## Task

Build and run the program and compare the output with what the code is doing. Everything is named uniquely so you can match up the output to the lines of code.

Come up with ways in which you could modify the function and either retain the behaviour or change it - note down your postulations then try them, were you right?

If you find this all-too-easy, try writing a function that takes a `std::string***&` and can detect if any level of pointer is null. You may choose whether to default-fill-in the object at that point or display an error.
